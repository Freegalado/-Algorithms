# Smallest Minimum Multiple

## Statement of the problem

2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder.

What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20?

The problem tries to find the smallest positive integer divisible by a and b, and I present two possible ways to solve it. The first is by means of its greatest common divisor, which synthesizes and speeds up the calculation. The second is by brute force, in which we check that each positive integer is divisible without remainder by a and b, which takes more time.

## Result

The positive integer we are looking for is **232792560**.
